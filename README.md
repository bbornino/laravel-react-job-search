## About the Author
This project has been written by Bornino.  It is intended to be more of a demonstration of my abilities to easily learn new languages and MVCs.  The original fully featured project, which is functionlly used on a daily basis, is the [Ruby On Rails version](https://bornino.net/projects/ruby-app/).  I am the sole author however I will gladly entertain feedback and useful enhancements.


## About the Project
This project is a Laravel MVC (PHP backend) with React.JS front-end code.  The application is used for tracking job hunting.  More specifically, the fields are set for focusing on recruiters emails when they contact me through their distribution lists.  The fields are similiar in scope to the main Ruby app.  Build and run this app the way you would normally do so using Laravel. More information is located on my web site [Laravel - React](https://bornino.net/projects/php-laravel-react-js-recruitment-tracker/) page. 

## Versions Used
The code was developed and tested using:
- PHP 8.2
- Laravel 11.7.0
- SQLite
